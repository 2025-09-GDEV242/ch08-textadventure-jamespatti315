 GOALS

Mandatory features:
If any of the following steps are not completed, the assignment will not be graded until they are fixed.
Every class must have a meaningful javadoc class header with appropriate text and updated @author and @version directives
Every method must have a meaningful javadoc method comment with appropriate directives (@param, @return, @throws, etc.)
The javadoc for your project must be generated and in the doc directory in your project directory
There must be a main method for the game class that allows the game to be run outside of BlueJ
(The game can still be invoked from within BlueJ by instantiating the Game class and invoking play() method)
Your map must contain at least 8 rooms, though it may contain more if you wish
Everyone must add a command to the process command method
8.14 - add the look command to your game (p 303) 
 
Steps to complete the game play:
Items in the game - each room can hold multiple items
Partial implementation
8.20/8.21 (p 308) - add items to your game. Each room can have one item in it. Items have description and weight. When printing room info, Item name should be included
Full implementation
8.22 (p 308)- extension to items - make it so rooms can hold multiple items
Streamline going to previous rooms
Partial implementation
8.23 (p 309,310) - implement the back command (back one room) 


Full implementation
8.26 - implement the go back many rooms version of the command command (back repeatedly retraces your steps)
Responsibility Driven Design - Add a Player Class to represent the player (p 314)
Partial implementation
8.28 - a Player class as described
8.29 - A player can pick up a single item
Full implementation
8.30 -  a player can pick up any number of items
